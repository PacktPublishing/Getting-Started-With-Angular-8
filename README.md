# Gettting Started With Angular 8
Gettting Started With Angular 8, Published by Packt

In this repo you will find an example application that shows how an Angular application is set up. The repo is divided up into sub-folders, one per chapter. In each chapter folder you will find the same application, but amended with further changes based on the topic of that chapter. 

Within each folder the Readme file has been updated with a list of the changes made in that version of the project.


## The Example Application

Through out the related book, we have an example application which aims to show the various parts of Angular. In each folder is a new version of the example application, but with further changes based around the topic of the chapter.

The only chapter where this is different is in Chapter 9, where we have a small NgRx based application that shows how state within an application is managed within NgRx.
